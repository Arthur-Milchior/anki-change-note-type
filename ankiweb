Currently, changing a note type require to sync the entire collection. This add-on symply removes this restriction and assumethat you, the user, will act wisely in order to avoid creating bugs.

It means that you must sync all your devices before changing a note type, and then sync them after the note type. I.e. you must act exactly has you would have done without this add-on.
