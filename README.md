"Change card's type" does not require a new upload of the database.
The only downside being that the identifier of the note change. 
I.e. you lose the content provided by the «info» button (i.e. the list of dates at which you clicked on again, hard, good, easy).
Note however that the number of leech, the easyness, the date of next review, etc... are all preserved.
